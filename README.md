# Data Engineering Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python-based data engineering exercises and mini-projects completed during university coursework.

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate practical skills in:

- Data cleaning and transformation
- Working with structured and semi-structured data
- Data reshaping (wide ↔ long formats)
- Time series processing
- SQL querying and window functions
- Geospatial data processing
- File format conversions (CSV, JSON, Excel, Pickle)
- Working with relational databases (SQLite)

All projects are implemented using Python and common data engineering libraries.
